XMT: eXtended Mobile Platform.
Alternate definition: An abbreviation for radio transmit.


The primary goal of the XMT platform is to run traditional keyboard and mouse applications without the keyboard or mouse.

A secondary goal is to allow use of the device with gloves, allowing the device to be used in extreme conditions.
I brain stormed this idea after needing to check on the status of network hardware while climbing towers in subzero temps and high winds.
it is extremely dangerous having to remove gloves and possibly freezing your hands on a tower. That is why I want the device to function with heavy gloves.
