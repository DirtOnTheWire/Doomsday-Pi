The primary goal of the XMT platform is to run traditional keyboard and mouse applications without the keyboard or mouse. And use the raspberry pi single board computer formfactor.

A secondary goal is to allow use of the device with gloves, allowing the device to be used in extreme conditions.
I brain stormed this idea after needing to check on the status of network hardware while climbing towers in subzero temps and high winds.
It is extremely dangerous to remove your gloves and risk freezing your hands on a tower. That is why I want the device to still be operable while wearing heavy gloves.
