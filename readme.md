The XMT platform's design goal is to extend a keyboard and mouse input to a mobile device without a physical keyboard or mouse.

A secondary goal is to allow use of the device with gloves, allowing the device to be used in extreme conditions. One use case scenario I designed the hardware for is logging into communication backhauls on a tower in subzero temperatures.

# How it works

The platform is built on top of debian-xfce and i3wm. The project primarily consists of custom i3 configs and gpio scripts that are mapped to specific mod keys in i3wm. Ironically i3wm works really well on a touchscreen provided you have an onscreen keyboard. Combine this with physical mod buttons (like a gamepad) it is very usable.
