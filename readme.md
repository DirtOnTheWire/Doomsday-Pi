# XMT: eXtended Mobile Platform.
## Alternate definition: An abbreviation for radio transmit.

-  The XMT platform's design goal is to extend a keyboard and mouse input to a mobile device without a physical keyboard or mouse.

-  A secondary goal is to allow use of the device with gloves, allowing the device to be used in extreme conditions. One use case scenario I designed the hardware for is logging into communication backhauls on a tower in subzero temperatures.

## How it works

The platform is built on top of debian-xfce and i3wm. The project primarily consists of custom i3 configs and gpio scripts that are mapped to specific mod keys in i3wm. Tiling window managers work really well on a touchscreen provided you have an onscreen keyboard. Combine this with physical mod buttons (like a gamepad) it is very usable.



## Modes of operation

Because this device will be used for multiple purposes including gaming the interface will use profiles to manage different key maps.

## Desktop mode

This will remap to a more generic i3 config
